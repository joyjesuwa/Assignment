            <h3>1. Traveling in a D. T. C. Bus</h3>
            <p>Delhi is a crowded city. 
                There are very few rich people who travel by their own vehicles. 
                The majority of the people cannot afford to hire a taxi or a three-wheeler.
                 They have to depend on D.T.C. buses, which are the cheapest mode of conveyance.
                  D.T.C. buses are like blood capillaries of our body spreading all over in Delhi.
                   One day I had to go to railway station to receive my uncle. 
                   I had to reach there by 9.30 a.m. knowing the irregularity of D.T.C. 
                   bus service; I left my home at 7.30 a.m. and reached the bus stop. 
                   There was a long queue.
                    Everybody was waiting for the bus but the buses were passing one after another without stopping. 
                    I kept waiting for about an hour. 
                    I was feeling very restless and I was afraid that I might not be able to reach the station in time. 
                    It was 8.45. Luckily a bus stopped just in front of me.
                     It was overcrowded but somehow I managed to get into the bus. 
                     Some passengers were hanging on the footboard, so there was no question of getting a seat. 
                     It was very uncomfortable. We were feeling suffocated. 
                     All of a sudden, an old man declared that his pocket had been picked. 
                     He accused the man standing beside him. The young man took a knife out of his pocket and waved it in the air.
                      No body dared to catch him. I thanked God when the bus stopped at the railway station.
                       I reached there just in time.

                    <h3>2. Look Before You Leap</h3>
                    <p>The proverb has deep meaning, which is always useful for a successful life.
                         It conveys the idea that we should always think and then act accordingly. 
                         Impulsive actions may lead us to embarrassing and odd situations.
                          As we should always think before we speak, in the same way we should think before we act. 
                          Life is full of various factors, 
                          the factors which can fascinate us for the moment but may lead us to failure or the factors which can repel immediately 
                          but may be the stepping stones to success. For example, 
                          going to a movie or playing video games may seem an attractive thing for the time being but can, 
                          in the course of time not only disturb one’s studies but also injure our eyes. 
                          Therefore, we should always restrain our intuitive and impulsive desires and then act according to what our mind says is right.
                           Even the great men like Gandhi.
                            Nehru, John Kennedy have been prey to their passions and emotions due to which the nations suffered.
                             We should learn from their lives and should always act thoughtfully.

                        <h3>3. Rising Prices</h3>
                        <p>There are many intelligent people in the economic field who would tell us that rising of prices is a phenomenon, 
                            which is characteristic of a developing economy. 
                            But inflation can be beneficial only if production and national income of the country also increase. 
                            But in our country, national income and production do not increase in proportion to the rise in price due to various diverse factors.
                             Since independence, India faced such problems that in spite of major steps taken to improve the economy, 
                             our economy has not come up to our expectations. 
                             India was attacked by Pakistan and then China in the earlier years of her freedom. 
                             It took years to recover from the heavy losses of the war. Then large-scale industries,
                              like Iron and Steel showed losses in earlier stages. This also caused hike in price. 
                              Nowadays the main reason behind this unbalanced gallop in price is black money.
                               Government is trying hard to control prices by coming down heavily on corrupt officers. 
                               It’s taking proper steps to control prices which are causing economic hardships in a commoner’s life. 
                               But all these measures will take time to show results.
                                At present the rising of prices is a painful reality which cannot be avoided in our day to day life.</p>
