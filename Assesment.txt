b. Removal of Classes, Methods, and Packages. The Package mock. 
c. Core Container Enhancements. 
d. Reactive Programming Model. 
e. General Web Improvements. 
f. Testing Improvements.

2. What is a Spring Framework?
Ans:-
   Spring is a lightweight framework. It can be thought of as a framework of frameworks 
because it provides support to various frameworks such as Struts, Hibernate, Tapestry, EJB, JSF, etc. 
The framework, in broader sense, can be defined as a structure where we find solution of the various technical problems.
The Spring framework comprises several modules such as IOC, AOP, DAO, Context, ORM, WEB MVC etc.

3. List the advantages of Spring Framework
Ans:-
   Light Weight,
Flexible
Loose Coupling
Powerful Abstraction
Portable
Dependency Injection

4.What are the different features of Spring Framework?
Ans:-
   IoC (Inversion of Control) Container. 
Support for aspect-oriented programing. 
Data access framework. 
Transaction management framework. 
Spring MVC framework. 
Spring web service. 
Spring test frameworks. 
Core container.

5.How many modules are there in Spring Framework and what are they?
Ans:-
   The Spring framework comprises of many modules such as core, beans, context, expression language,
 AOP, Aspects, Instrumentation, JDBC, ORM, OXM, JMS, Transaction, Web, Servlet, Struts etc.

6.What is a Spring configuration file?
Ans:-
   Spring configuration file is a file with . xml extension and the file contains information about the classes and interfaces and their dependencies. 
Using this file the spring container controls the life cycle of a spring bean and also Dependency Injection is achieved.

   Spring Boot Starters
Spring Boot AutoConfigurator
Spring Boot CLI
Spring Boot Actuator
Spring Initilizr
Spring Boot IDEs

8.What are the various ways of using Spring Framework?
Ans:-
   xml-based configuration, when you describe configuration in xml file;
java-based configuration, when configuration is Java class, marked with specific annotations;
groovy-based configuration, when configuration is file with Groovy code;

9.What is Spring IOC Container?
Ans:-
   Spring IoC Container is the core of Spring Framework. 
It creates the objects, configures and assembles their dependencies, manages their entire life cycle. 
The Container uses Dependency Injection(DI) to manage the components that make up the application.

10.What do you mean by Dependency Injection?
Ans:-
   Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that removes the dependency from the programming code 
so that it can be easy to manage and test the application. Dependency Injection makes our programming code loosely coupled.
